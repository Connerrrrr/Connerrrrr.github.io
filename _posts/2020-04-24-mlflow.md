## Background

As Azure machine learning service is integrated with MLOps, which does not offer powerful model registry as MLflow does, it is required to design customized architecture to host MLflow central server. Meanwhile, kubernetes has consolidated its popularity as a portable, extensible, open-source platform. It is feasible to put everything on Azure Kubernetes Service.

## Architecture Design
