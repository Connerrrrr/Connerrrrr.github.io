I'm a Computer Science student from the University of Toronto, specializing in Software Engineering Stream and minor in Statistics. Meanwhile, I have a huge interest and career goal in AI, data science, cloud development, DevOps, and IoT based on my previous experiences. I love spending time keeping up to date with cutting-edge technologies. Also, I am enthusiastic about financial markets, especially in the technology field.
